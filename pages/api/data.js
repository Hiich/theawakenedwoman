        stackText: "TAW‚Äôs vision is to have one of the most thriving communities in the NFT space motivating women to live their most magnificent lives through physical, mental, spiritual & financial wellness.We achieve this not just through our iconic community presence, engagement & sisterhood, but through the ‚ÄúThe Awakened Woman Society‚Äù, an educational hub our NFT holders gain immediate access to as they enter our world of Web3. With the Web3 market projected to be valued at $10 trillion dollars (that'‚Äô's trillion with a capital T) the next 10 years, we are aslo on a mission to be a collection making sure women aren‚Äôt left behind when 81% of web3 current participants  are male. With our vision to ensure women THRIVE in all areas of their life including financially, we are also one of the first NFTs globally in the space to have ‚Äòprofit sharing‚Äô as our main utility. Once the collection sells out, TAW is launching its own merchandise company whereby 50% of all profits go back to its NFT holders.",
